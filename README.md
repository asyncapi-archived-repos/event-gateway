  AsyncAPI Event Gateway

  <em>The Event Gateway solution by excellence</em>
</p>

# Overview

AsyncAPI **Event Gateway** (name is subject to change) is the Event Gateway solution by excellence.

Based on traditional API Gateways, it intercepts all incoming messages moving them into a pipeline of middlewares and handlers such as:

- Message validation
- Message manipulation
- Message aggregation
- Message filtering
- Authentication
- Throttling
- Routing
- Monitoring (including tracing)

It supports all the protocols AsyncAPI supports through [bindings](https://github.com/asyncapi/bindings).

This **Event Gateway** is also compatible with the HTTP protocol, natively or trough an external provider like [Krakend.io](http://krakend.io).

AsyncAPI also offers a Marketplace where users can install middlewares for the **Event Gateway** made by the community and also some officially maintained by the AsyncAPI org.
